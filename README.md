# Hyperledger Fabric

  Hyperledger Fabric is a blockchain platform designed specifically for enterprise-level application within buisnesses. Its modular architecture provides the stability    and confidentiality necessary to build a network of multiple organisations with shared data. One of the most notable features of the fabric is its ability to write smart contracts or chaincode in various programming languages like Go, Java, and Node.js (Here Node.js). This flexibility allows easier integration with a wider availability of language support. The platform is open-sourced and also offers comprehensive documentation, making it an accessible blockchain solution for developers and buisnesses.
  
  Additionally, Hyperledger provides robust identity management, allowing participants to control their data and access to the network. This permissioned architecture makes it a secure and efficient blockchain solution for enterprise-level applications.
